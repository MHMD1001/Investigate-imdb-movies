# Movie Data Analysis Readme
This repository contains the code and analysis for a project focused on analyzing a dataset containing information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (IMDb). The analysis was conducted using Python and several popular libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. The main goal of the project was to answer a series of questions related to movie production, popularity, revenue, and user ratings.

# Project Overview
The primary aim of this project was to perform data analysis on a movie dataset to gain insights into various aspects of the movie industry. The analysis process involved cleaning and exploring the dataset, extracting relevant information, and visualizing the findings to address the following questions:

Number of Movies Produced Every Year: The project aimed to determine the number of movies produced each year, providing an overview of the industry's growth over time.

Most Popular Movie Genre for Each Year: The analysis aimed to identify the most popular movie genre for each year in the dataset, giving insights into genre trends over time.

Relationship Between Budget and Popularity: The project explored whether there is a correlation between a movie's budget and its popularity.

Relationship Between Budget and User Ratings: The analysis aimed to determine if there is a connection between a movie's budget and its user ratings.

Properties Associated With High Revenue: The project focused on identifying the key properties and characteristics of movies that tend to generate higher revenues.

# Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

data: This directory contains the raw dataset used for the analysis. The dataset includes information about movies, such as their release year, genre, budget, revenue, popularity, and user ratings.

notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter Notebook files where the data analysis was conducted step by step. Each notebook corresponds to a specific analysis question and includes code, explanations, visualizations, and results.

images: This directory stores images and visualizations generated during the analysis. These images are used in the Jupyter Notebook files to illustrate the findings.

README.md: The current file you are reading. It provides an overview of the project, its goals, structure, and instructions for reproducing the analysis.

# Reproducing the Analysis
