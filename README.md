# Investigate-imdb-movies
In this project, I analyzed a data set that contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (IMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
by using Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib
I went through the data analysis process to answer the following questions : 
What is the number of movies preduced every year?
What is the most popular movie genre for each year?
Does spending more money is associated with higher popularity ?
Does spending more money is associated with higher users ratings?
What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
